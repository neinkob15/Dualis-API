# Dualis API

This is an unofficial API for dualis by DHBW built with Bash. This one file lets you retrieve all grades as json.<br/>
The interface can be used by all sorts of applications for automating things concerning grades.

Options: <br/>
 -u	Set username (f.e. muster.max@dh-karlsruhe.de)<br/>

The options -u and -p are mandatory fields, without them, grades cannot be gathered.
